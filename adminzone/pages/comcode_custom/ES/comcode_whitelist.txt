[title]Edit Comcode whitelist[/title]

Normally there is a set of Comcode tags that regular users simply cannot use. However, with the whitelist addon you can define a list of special cases, portions of Comcode that are allowed regardless of the limitation on the tag itself.
Put each sequence of Comcode on its own line below, and make sure that each line starts and ends with the open/close for the tag that is being whitelisted on (i.e. each line should look like [tt][tag...]...[/tag][/tt]). Alternatively you can also use [url="regular expressions"]http://php.net/manual/en/book.pcre.php[/url], if you surround with slashes and encode things appropriately.
