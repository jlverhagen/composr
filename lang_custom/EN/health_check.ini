PERFORMANCE=Performance
AUTOMATIC_CHECKS=Automatic checks
CONFIG_GROUP_DEFAULT_DESCRIP_FLOOD_CONTROL=These options will only work if rate-limiting is enabled and configured. These options don't define additional rate-limits, they just define when to flag up high rates as a health problem to be investigated.

HC_PAGE_SPEED_THRESHOLD=Maximum page load time
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_page_speed_threshold=The maximum time in seconds after which a page request is considered slow. The default threshold is quite high because we may have stale caches or load spiking; we're looking for major issues, not testing our overall optimisation.
