HOSTING_FILE_GONE_MISSING=Your server did not return an error when uploading the file, but the file appears to gone have missing from your server. This may be because you have exceeded your file quota, the file is larger than the server allows, or the file is otherwise somehow prohibited. If this error persists please consult your webhost.

CMS_COPYWAIT=Copying may take a few minutes. Please be patient. We assume that your FTP server runs on the standard port 21, and unfortunately cannot support FTP-SSL or SFTP.
