[title="2"]Defining an Author[/title]

Manage author(s) from Content Management > Authors.

There is a permission to allow members to define author profiles that bind to their own member profile. If the 'define an author' page was not entered from a link to define/edit a referenced author, it will default to defining/editing the author of the username of the current user: it is through this that a member defines their own author profile.

To define a profile for another author, it is first necessary to add some author supporting content, and then to choose to define the author from the Admin Zone author management page.

[title="2"]View a Author[/title]

[media width="150" description="Viewing an author profile" float="left"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_authors/authors_view.png[/media]
Links are placed on author-supporting content view pages to view details of the content author, as well as in the Conversr member profile of a member with a bound author profile.

The 'view an author' screen will display the author profile, as well as downloads that they are set as the author of.

[title="2"]Merging authors[/title]

[surround]
[media width="150" description="Managing/Merging authors" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_authors/authors_manage.png[/media]
The Admin Zone provides a module for merging authors. This feature is provided as it is likely that different users will refer to authors with slightly different names at the point of submission.

[title="2"]A note about security[/title]

If you grant members the Conversr "Change own username" privilege (or equivalent in a 3rd party forum driver), then you may want to deny access to the "Set own author profile" privilege to regular members, as otherwise members could hijack any non-member-associated author accounts to renaming their account to match the name of that account.
