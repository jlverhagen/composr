[title sub="Written by Chris Graham (ocProducts)"]Composr Tutorial: Advanced access control[/title]

There are more ways that you could wish to control access than we have direct options within Composr.
Some software tries to make options for everything, but the result tends to be too many assumptions and too much configuration complexity. Our approach is to give you some additional general-purpose tools for defining your own permissions, giving you increased flexibility overall, while keeping the core permission system relatively intuitive.

[b]Important[/b]: Understand that checking means 'deny access' when it comes to match-key permissions. It's the opposite of how permission checkboxes usually work.

You may wish to prevent members viewing the member directory, but let them view their own profile

This cannot be done directly using page permissions because both actions go through the same module. Match-key permissions can be used effectively here though.

[list="1"]
[*] Make sure the [tt]match_key_permissions[/tt] addon is installed.
[*] If the "Single public zone" option is on then:
 - Set to block all groups on [tt]:members:browse[/tt]
If the "Single public zone" option is [i]not[/i] on then:
 - Set to block all groups on [tt]site:members:browse[/tt]
[/list]
[/surround]

[title="2"]Match-key error messages[/title]

You can define custom error messages that show when an access-denied screen is shown on a particular match-key. You can also put in URLs and page-links instead of messages, and these will work to trigger a redirect (useful if you want to design an elaborate page, e.g. a signup page).

If you put in a URL instead of a match-key, it will automatically convert to a match-key.

If you put in some text between quote marks, matching will be done on the basis of matching this to success/notice/warning/error messages (which is broader than match-keys, as Composr is programmed to mostly only consider whether these match when showing access-denied screens). You can even combine quoted strings and match-keys, for a double condition, e.g.: [tt]site:downloads "There are no entries at this time"[/tt] could be given a message of [tt]Nobody has added a download yet[/tt]. As you can see, this has nothing really to do with permissions: we can use this system much more broadly, to do some quite detailed specification of how Composr should message the user.

A good example of match-key error messages is in the [page="_SEARCH:sup_join_disabling"]How to disable joining tutorial[/page].

[title="2"]Controlling page display in detail[/title]

You may wish to only show certain parts of screens to particular usergroups. For example, you may want to 'tease' content to non-paying users.
To implement this, you need to switch to a template editing mind-set, rather than a permissions mind-set. Use normal Tempcode techniques to fence off or change the output of templates, either:
[list="a"]
[*] by using the [tt]IS_IN_GROUP[/tt] symbol
[*] working off the back of a standard permission's setting using something like the [tt]HAS_PRIVILEGE[/tt] symbol)
[/list]

For example,
[code="Tempcode"]
{+START,IF,{$IS_IN_GROUP,3-7,10}}
    Only groups 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10, see this.
{+END}
[/code]

These techniques also work within Comcode pages.
