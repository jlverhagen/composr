[title="2"]The administration module[/title]

The administration module resides in Admin Zone > Audit > Site statistics.

Be aware that hits coming from the web server itself will be filtered from the stats, so if you are running a web server on your own computer you may not see any results if nobody else has used your website yet.

[title="3"]Installing geo-location data[/title]

{!stats:DOC_INSTALL_GEOLOCATION_DATA} That said, the separate install is usually automatic because the Composr installer creates a background task for it. If that has not happened somehow then you can go to Admin Zone > Audit > Site statistics > Install geolocation data, which will reschedule a task. If you don't see this option, you do have geolocation data installed already
[/surround]

[box="Important -- keep it going"]
Do not disturb the geolocation data installation process. You will be informed when it is complete.
[/box]

Once the geo-location data is installed, all the extra statistics can be used.

[surround]
[media width="150" description="The download statistics box" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_statistics/statistics_download_statistics.png[/media]
There is a screen for download statistics, but you may also wish to allow your visitors to see some trends...

There are two methods for revealing download trends to your visitors:
1) Download statistics are generally available on an individual download page
2) You can also pull out key downloads for the benefit of your visitors is to use one of the download blocks: [i]most popular downloads[/i], and [i]most recently-added downloads[/i]. These are explained below.
[/surround]

[title="2"]Other statistics[/title]

[media width="150" description="View statistics are shown for various forms of content" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_statistics/statistics_news_item_stats.png[/media]
All content will automatically store download/view statistics as appropriate, which will usually be displayed on the respective entry screen.

An example of this would be news entries: each news entry records how many times it is viewed, and displays this number on its view screen.

[title="2"]Conversr statistics[/title]

The following statistics screens exist to show [concept]Conversr[/concept] data:
 - Demographics (summarise the ages of your members)
 - Posting rates (identify trends in daily posting rates)

[title="2"]The statistics block[/title]

[media width="150" description="The [tt]side_stats[/tt] block" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_statistics/side_stats.png[/media]
The [tt]side_stats[/tt] block shows various figures that relate to your website's activity and archive size. The exact details shown are configurable (in the main Composr configuration) from quite a wide selection.

[title="2"]Real-time analytics[/title]

[media width="150" description="Real-time analytics" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_statistics/realtime_rain.png[/media]
{!realtime_rain:DOC_REALTIME_RAIN}

Access Real-time analytics from:
Admin Zone > Audit > What's happening now (RTR)

It is a good way to visualise how people are using the site. This works best when the site has multiple online users performing options, but you can move the timeline back to when stuff was happening previously (i.e. view activity from a historic viewpoint).

[title="2"]Google Analytics[/title]

[url="Google Analytics"]http://www.google.com/analytics/[/url] is an excellent free package for analysing website activity, allowing you to spot all kinds of trends in your data.

We don't consider Google Analytics a competitor to our own inbuilt analytics -- both offer different features, complementing each other. Google Analytics is easy to install, we have support built-in so you just need to enter your analytics code in the Composr configuration.

[concepts
 1_key="SVG"            1_value="Scaleable Vector Graphics, a text-markup-based graphics format that allows infinite scalability of graphics without texture loss due to being vector-based (co-ordinate-delimited shapes) instead of pixel based (specific data for each pixel)."
 2_key="Geo-location"   2_value="The process of using some type of individually-identifiable information to find out where in the world somebody is."
