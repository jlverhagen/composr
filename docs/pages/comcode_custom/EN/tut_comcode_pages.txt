[title sub="Written by Chris Graham (ocProducts)"]Composr Tutorial: Adding standalone pages of content (via Comcode)[/title]

You may easily add new pages of information to Composr by making a 'Comcode page'.

A Comcode page is a page in the system that you can edit either via a [concept]WYSIWYG[/concept] editor, or a very simple [concept]mark-up language[/concept] called Comcode, or a combination of both.

This documentation is written using Comcode in fact.

If you want to write a page without any special formatting, you can just type it out in plain-text, and this will usually be valid Comcode and display as you would expect it to. You can then add 'tags' to identify things such as titles and links.

This tutorial covers some basic information relating to Comcode pages.

[media width="150" description="The list of Comcode pages to be edited/deleted" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_comcode_pages/comcode_pages.png[/media]
Comcode pages may be selected for editing either:
[list="a"]
[*] From Content Management > Pages (Comcode pages), which gives you a table to choose from.
[*] By clicking the edit link underneath a page being viewed.
[/list]

The default Comcode pages are...

			<td>Panels are special pages that sit alongside all pages in a zone. They are like shared borders.<br />Composr 10+ does not use left/right panels by default. Some are there out-of-the-box in the system, but blank. If you do panels you can set them up by editing them like normal pages.</td>

[title="2"]URLs[/title]

[surround]
Like any page in Composr, a Comcode page is accessed by using:
[tt]http://yourbaseurl/<zone>/index.php?page=<page-name>[/tt]

Actually If you are using a URL Scheme, then it may be something else (depending on which [page="_SEARCH:tut_short_urls"]URL Scheme[/page] you use):
 - [tt]http://yourbaseurl/<zone>/pg/<page-name>[/tt]
 - [tt]http://yourbaseurl/<zone>/<page-name>.htm[/tt]
 - [tt]http://yourbaseurl/<zone>/<page-name>[/tt]
[/surround]

[title="2"]Adding a new page[/title]

[surround]
[media width="150" description="The easy way to add a Comcode page" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_comcode_pages/comcode_pages_easyadd.png[/media]
There are two ways to add a new Comcode page in Composr.

Method 1:
[list="a"]
[*] Click the browser address bar
[*] Just type in the URL to where you want the page to be
[*] Click the given link to add the missing page
[/list]
[/surround]

[surround]
[media width="150" description="Choosing to add a page" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_comcode_pages/add_page_box.png[/media]
Method 2:
[list="a"]
[*] Go to Content Management > Pages (Comcode pages)
[*] Scroll down
[*] Give a new page name in the [tt]<zone>:<page-name>[/tt] format Composr uses in the list of pages that already exist (where a page in the Welcome Zone would just be [tt]:<page-name>[/tt])

(If you don't use a colon, a default zone will be picked)
[/list]
[/surround]

[title="3"]Proceeding to edit the page[/title]

[surround]
[media width="150" description="The edited Comcode page looks like this" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_comcode_pages/comcode_pages_view.png[/media]
[media width="150" description="Editing a Comcode page" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_comcode_pages/comcode_pages_edit.png[/media]
Once the Comcode page editor is open, you can pretty much just type your page in.

This screen is exactly the same both for adding a new page and editing an existing page.


[b]If WYSIWYG is on[/b]:

[indent="20"]
You'll have a nice editor to use.
[/indent]

[b]If WYSIWYG is off[/b]:

[indent="20"]
You'll pretty much type plain-text, with small diversions to indicate special formatting (most notably, the [tt]title[/tt] tag, which every page should include).

It is beyond the scope of this tutorial to explain Comcode: see the [page="_SEARCH:tut_comcode"]Comcode and the attachment system tutorial[/page] for this.
[/indent]

[title="2"]Deleting pages[/title]

You can delete a Comcode page from the bottom of its edit form.
[/surround]

[title="2"]Page templates[/title]

[media float="right" thumb="0" framed="0"]data_custom/images/docs/advantage.png[/media]
There are a number of built-in page templates available. These are shown when you add a new page from Content Management > Pages.

The templates are designed to help you in the following ways:
 - So you don't need to think too hard about what kind of pages your site would benefit from
  - Note we don't provide an FAQ page template because we have a default FAQ catalogue instead
 - So you get some reasonable default layouts and graphics (any website benefits greatly from professional design, but the samples are enough to get most sites started)
 - Specific and detailed advice you can work to, particularly on how to structure persuasive or engaging articles (we think we've saved you a lot of self-education here, bringing together techniques from journalism, PR, sales, and brand marketing, into a single set of convenient techniques)

[title="2"]Hiding pages from the Sitemap[/title]

There may be cases where you don't want a Comcode page to appear in your Sitemap. The easiest way to solve this is to preface the name of the Comcode page with an underscore (_). For example, pages named [tt]_test[/tt] and [tt]_example[/tt] will not show on the Sitemap due to starting with the underscore symbol.
